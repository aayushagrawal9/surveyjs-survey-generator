You are tasked with analyzing a given file to identify and extract structured parts that resemble surveys or questionnaires. Your goal is to output all survey questions and their corresponding options in a standardized XML format.

Please follow these steps


1. Carefully read through the entire text.

2. Identify parts that appear to be structured like surveys or questionnaires. Look for:

   - Numbered or lettered questions

   - Multiple choice options

   - Rating scales

   - Yes/No questions

3. For each identified survey question:

   - Extract the question text

   - Identify all associated answer options

4. Format each question and its options in XML, using the following structure:

   <question id="(Optional)">

     <text>[Question text here]</text>

     <options>

       <option>[Option 1]</option>

       <option>[Option 2]</option>

       ...

     </options>

   </question>



Here's an example of how a formatted question should look:



<question id="GP3">

  <text>Because of my physical condition, I have trouble meeting the needs of my family</text>

  <options>

    <option>Not at all</option>

    <option>A little bit</option>

    <option>Somewhat</option>

    <option>Quite a bit</option>

    <option>Very much</option>

  </options>

</question>



The information will be passed to a survey generator that will only feature one question per page but may be divided into sections. Pay explicit attention that each <section> should contain all the information needed to answer all questions within that section. If you encounter something where not all options are defined FOR EXAMPLE a linear scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing bad and 5 good, explicitly provide a legend that explains the values followed by <option>s that contain the actual selectable values (1,2,3,4,5 in this example)

Wrap the entire set of questions into <survey> </survey> tags

Make sure to include ALL identified survey questions and their options, even if they appear in different parts of the text.

Your final output should be a series of <question> elements, each containing a <text> element and an <options> element with nested <option> elements, all wrapped in a root <survey> tag. Do not include any other text or explanations in your output.
